# Daily planner app

## Description

For this task, I had to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. Skills included:

- **DOM manipulation**
- **Advanced JavaScript**
- **Integration of third-party APIs**

## How it works

The current date is displayed at the top of the calendar when a user opens it. Timeblocks are displayed for an 8am-4pm working day when the user scrolls down.

These timeblocks are colour-coded by past, future and present. For example, if you view the 7am block at 8am, it will be coloured to show it was in the past. If you view the 7am block at the same time, it will show the present colour, and at 6am it will show the future colour

The user can enter their task or event by clicking into the timeblock, and these entries are saved in local storage. These entries still display after refreshing the page.

## Usage

To try out the planner for yourself, just click on a timeblock to enter a plan and click the save icon. You can also view the current date and the colours to indicate if your entry is in the past, present or future. Refresh the page to make sure your entries are saved.
